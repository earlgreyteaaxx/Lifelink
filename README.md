## Features

- **Mesh Networking**: Establish a network using Bluetooth and Wi-Fi Direct among nearby devices to form a reliable communication link without needing internet access.
- **Text Messaging**: Send and receive text messages across the mesh network.
- **Location Sharing**: Share real-time locations with other users to help locate and organize groups during emergencies.
- **Emergency Alerts**: Broadcast emergency alerts and important information to all connected devices.
